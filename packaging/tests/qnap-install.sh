# --- the package format -------------------------------------------------

# freshly built package contains what it should. It knows the format by
# hand, so the format gets a test: build a package with the same three
# parts qbuild concatenates - installer script, control tar, gzipped data
# tar - and the 100-byte QNAPQPKG trailer that comes after them, then
# take it apart again. The trailer is the interesting part. It is why
# reading the data archive to end-of-file does not work, and why the dd
# count in the installer's own header is not the answer either: that
# count is rounded up to a kibibyte, so it reaches past the archive and
# into the trailer on any package whose payload is not an exact multiple.
