# Build the Synology DSM 7 package (.spk) from the static musl binaries
# already attached to the GitHub Release - the same trick push-image.sh
# uses, so the package ships the exact released bits and needs no
# cross-compiler here.
#
#   packaging/synology/make-spk.sh 1.0.11 [outdir]
#
# Produces ONE package, nzbfast-<ver>-noarch.spk, carrying both the
# x86_64 and aarch64 binaries; scripts/postinst keeps the one this NAS can
# run and deletes the other.
#
# One file rather than one per architecture, for two reasons that both
# come back to not asking users questions they cannot answer:
#   - DSM's package-source protocol filters by arch on the SERVER (the
#     feed returns a different package list per arch and carries no arch
#     field for the client to filter on), so a static host like GitHub
#     Pages cannot serve a per-arch feed from one URL. noarch means one
#     URL works for every model.
#   - Nobody downloading a .spk by hand has to know whether their NAS is
#     Intel or ARM.
# The cost is one unused binary inside the download, which postinst then
# removes from disk.
#
# Why a native package and not a container: DSM's Package Center is where
# most Synology owners install things, and a package can claim its own
# port, make its own folders and register its own service, so install is
# one click instead of a compose file and a wizard full of mount points.
#
# DSM 7 does NOT sign third-party packages - the codesign mechanism was
# removed, and with it DSM 6's "trust level" setting. Users get one
# unavoidable "not verified by Synology" prompt and that is the whole
# friction. There is no certificate to buy and nothing to configure here.
