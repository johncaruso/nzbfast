# NOT inside the package directory, and this is the whole reason the

# `rsync -a --delete` followed by `rm -rf` over $QPKG_DIR - so anything
# kept in there is deleted by a single click in the App Center, with no
# undo and no warning that mentions downloads. An upgrade is safe (QDK
# only removes files the PREVIOUS package shipped and this one does not),
# but uninstall is not, and one wrong click should not cost somebody a
# terabyte and their server passwords.
#
# The layout is the container's, exactly:
#     <data>/config      config.json, settings.json, apikey, index.db, .spool
#     <data>/downloads
#     <data>/watch
# which is what the compose file maps at /config, /downloads and /watch.
# Anyone moving off Container Station already has that folder, and the
# reuse pass below picks it up as it stands rather than starting them
# over with an empty install.

# An upgrade must never move somebody's data. If the env file is there,
# it is the source of truth and nothing here gets a vote.
