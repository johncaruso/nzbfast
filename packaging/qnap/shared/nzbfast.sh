# QPKG service program. QTS links this into /etc/init.d and calls it with
# start, stop, restart or remove - at boot, from the App Center's buttons,
# and from the uninstall script.
#
# It launches the daemon directly, with a pidfile, rather than handing it
# to an init system. QTS has no per-package supervisor to hand it to:
# App Center reads the pidfile named in qpkg.cfg to decide whether the app
# is running, and that is the whole contract. (The Synology package next
# door arrives at the same shape from the opposite direction - DSM HAS
# systemd and will not let an unsigned package near it.)
#
# What is given up is automatic restart on a crash. QTS does start the
# package at boot by calling this script, which is the part that matters.
